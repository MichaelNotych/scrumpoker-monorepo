# Scrum Poker App

Scrum Poker is a collaborative estimation tool used by Agile teams to assign effort points to user stories. It helps teams reach a consensus on task complexity using a gamified approach.

## How it works
1. **Create a Room**: One team member creates a room and invites others to join
2. **Voting Process**: The team discusses a task, and each participant selects an estimation value (from the Fibonacci sequence) for a given task.
3. **Reveal Estimates**: Once all votes are submitted, the results are revealed, allowing discussion and refinement.
4. **Consensus**: The team agrees on the final estimation and moves on to the next task.
